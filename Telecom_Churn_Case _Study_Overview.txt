We had 130+ columns and 14945 rows in the dataset at the start after performing the data cleaning and manipulation
After that we handled class imabalance using SMOTE technique and had 136 columns in the dataset
We ran our first logistic regression and got an accuracy and recall of 85% and 87% approximately on train set
The same logistic regression was not satisfying the test data as it had accuracy and recall of about 81% and 71%.
As we had a lot of features so we used PCA on the data which reduced the features to 58 explaining 96% of variance.
Moving further we applied Logistic Regression on the data undergone PCA and were driven by an accuracy of 80% and recall of 78% on test data
Moreover, we performed hyperparameter tuning using Grid searchCV which resulted in an accuracy of 80% and recall of 79%
Then we tried another hyperparameter in Logistic Regression-class_weight. So instead of using SMOTE, we performed PCA and selected features explaing 97% variance(~69 principle components).
Performed hyper parameter tuning of C and class weight using GridSearchCV and built a model with 72% accuracy and 84% recall.
Since we want to correctly predit Churned customers, we selected model with higher recall and compromised a little on accuracy. So our final prediction model is Logistic regression with custom class_weight hyperparameter .

First we build the Decision tree with max_depth=5 and other parameters and default, we got an accuracy of 80% and recall of 60%
We performed hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search CV and obtained a best score of 90% with an accuracy of 86%
Random forest model was used to train the data and hyperparameter tuning of max_depth, min_samples leaf, min_samples_split and max_feature gave us a recall of approximately 89% and accuracy of 88%.
This model was used to predict the best features that were strong predictors of churning of the customers
